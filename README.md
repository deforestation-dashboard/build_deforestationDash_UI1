# build_deforestationDash_UI2

Proposal

- What problem does your app solve?

The Deforestation app is about using information to create a passionate and caring base of follower to help combat deforestion around the world
	
- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?

Our app provides information in a clear concice way that helps inform the public of the issue with supporting pages on how to help fight this growing problem.

- What is the mission statement?

Driving A Better Tomorrow, Through Information Today. We are here to provide the information needed to help people make good decisions and to help influence healthy change throughout the world.

- What features are required for your minimum viable product?

1. A interactive map that allows users to see how deforestation is a growing problem
2. A variety of information on how they can get involved and how they can help change the world.
3. A predictive model to show users where we will be if they dont help us influence healthy change.
	
- What features may you wish to put in a future release?

1. A map that showes the change in population of trees by the change of forest population (in regards to curent population percentage) over a series of time range
2. Include smaller regions and show the biomes of these regions so we can better see where we need to help influence healthy change

- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?
Frameworks - Libraries

- What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using?

ReactJS, Redux, Redux-Thunk, Axios, React-Router, Styled-Components, Plotly, LESS and/or SASS

- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?  no
- Are you required to pay to use the API?  no
For Data Scientists


- Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1. 

https://github.com/manjulamishra/Deforestation

- You can gather information about the data set you’ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.

We will create a backend server to import data from multiple resources, analyze all inputs, and create a model that predicts future forest cover based upon historical data.

- Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)

We are considering using time series analysis that predicts future values of forest cover based on previously observed values.

- A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app

The output will be in JSON format

Target Audience

- Who is your target audience? Be specific.

	Anyone interested in how the forests of the world are changing with time!  As well as prospective employers that want to see some cool work done by Lambda students!

- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?

	Having an intuitive interface to view and navigate well representative graphs/plots built off solid data will make this app stand out.

- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?

Research

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
